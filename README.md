### Natalie Henderson

Deterministic validation systems for requirements fidelity, operating envelopes, and decision provenance.

**Active development**
- Hiring Requirements Evaluator — deterministic evaluation of hiring criteria vs structured candidate attributes

**Planned engines (design-defined, implementation pending)**
- Requirements Drift & Compliance Engine — spec vs observed divergence with traceable diffs
- Failure Envelope & Assumption Collapse Engine — validity boundaries and assumption violations
- Decision Provenance Engine — capture and reconstruct decision rationale over time
