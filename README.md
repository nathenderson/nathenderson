# Natalie Henderson

Engineering-focused student building and validating deterministic systems
for traceability and post-hoc reasoning under real operational constraints.

## Current Work
- **Deterministic Event Ordering Engine**  
  Small, correctness-critical system demonstrating explicit ordering rules,
  bounded assumptions, and reproducible outputs.

- **Threshold / Noise / Debounce Analysis**  
  Reproducible EE analysis of threshold-based decision logic under noise,
  sampling jitter, and debounce constraints.

- **CubeSat Mission State Reconstruction Engine** *(flagship, in progress)*  
  Batch analysis system for reconstructing mission timelines, effective
  configuration state, and decision context during post-anomaly review.

## Engineering Principles
- explicit assumptions
- bounded scope
- determinism and reproducibility
- failure-aware design
- auditability over feature breadth
